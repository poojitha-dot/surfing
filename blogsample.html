                surfing for kids.

Within the last 13 years, we’ve taught more families with kids to surf than we can count.

We understand the apprehension of booking an ocean vacation, especially with children.

We get many inquiries from families interested in our family surf camps but aren’t sure if it’s 
right for their kids. Whether they’re adults or youngsters, teaching people to surf safely and independently
 is our topmost goal.

We hope this honest and transparent blog eases your stresses and is the sign you’ve been looking for to book 
that family surf vacation!

“It was the perfect holiday for a family with kids. 10/10 would go again.”

What do we know about surfing for kids?
Having had so much experience with families trusting us, we’ve become accustomed to teaching kids to surf 
and ensuring their safety in the ocean.

In writing a blog based on safety for kids, we want to keep it both informative and fun.

I sat down with the surf-obsessed 7 and 11-year-old daughters of co-owners Travis and Pilar and asked them their 
thoughts on surfing for kids. Who better to ask, right?

The thoughts they shared with me are scattered throughout the blog, but you can jump to the main part here.

Beyond this, co-founders Adrianne and Travis have also been surfing since they were young. Adrianne, aged 20, 
and Travis, aged 12. Travis has even been teaching kids to surf since he was 20!
